# GifTastic

When the user clicks on a button, the page grabs 10 static, non-animated gif images from the GIPHY API and place them on the page.

When the user clicks one of the still GIPHY images, the gif should animate. If the user clicks the gif again, it should stop playing.

The rating is display next to the gif (PG, G, so on).

This data is provided by the GIPHY API.

There is a search button for the user to enter their favorite car model.  Once the user submits his car model, it gets added to my topic arrays, creates a button at the top of the page.  When user clicks on the newly created, the 10 gifs will populate in the container.
